Ideally this application would be deployed automatically using either github along with jenkins or via gitlab. The ideal method to deployed it would be to have someone open a branch as I have for the initial work, perform the work and desired changes, open a pull request when ready and have a coworker review all the code changes and so long as everything checks out, approve the PR at which point the initial employee will merge the changes and jenkins will proceed to deploy it. On the jenkins end, some work would be done to ideally turn this into a package for debian and redhat based systems and push it to a company owned repository allowing for the science teachers to update their systems and pull in the new updates.
